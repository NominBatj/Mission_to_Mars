# Mission to Mars
This project is Web Scraping with HTML/CSS. We used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a web browser and perform a web scrape. Also, we created an HTML/CSS portfolio to showcase projects.

## Step 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere using Jupyter Notebook
- Written code retrieves the full resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.
- Full resolution images of the hemispheres are added to the dictionary.
- Titles of the hemispheres have been added to the dictionary.
- Create a list containing a dictionary of full resolution image URL string and title for each hemisphere image.

## Step 2: Using MongoDB and Flask to display the data as HTML/CSS
- Create a scraping.py file containing code that extracts the full resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
- Update the Mongo database to contain the full resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
- Create an index.html file containing code that will display the full resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image. 
- After cleaning is complete, the web application contains all the information from this module, as well as full resolution images and titles for images of the four hemispheres.

## Step 3: Using Bootstrap 3 to modify the html file
- The webpage is mobile-responsive
- Two additional Bootstrap 3 components are used to style the webpage
